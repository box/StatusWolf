;                     a data point to be classified as anomalous. If you
;                     comment out any of the algorithms to remove them from

; std_dev_threshold - The number of std deviations away from normal a data
;                     point must be for it to be flagged
; memory_limit - Anomaly detection can be a memory hog, especially with a
;                metric timeseries with a lot of points, and will exceed
;                the default limit configured for PHP. This bumps that
